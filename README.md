# conan-template

Template repo for testing/learning how to use conan. 
Because Conan is a C++ package manager, this project 
will focus on C++ using CMake for build configuration.

The hope is to have a decent starter project for any
random ideas I get.

## Contents

- README.md - this file
- src - source code
- test - unit tests

## License

GPL because this is a learner project, and I doubt this will turn into anything significant.
